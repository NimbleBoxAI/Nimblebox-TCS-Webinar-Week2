Whereas, Deep Learning achieves great power and flexibility by learning to represent the world as nested hierarchy of concepts, with each concept defined in relation to simpler concepts, and more abstract representations computed in terms of less abstract ones.\n",

For regression and binary classification tasks, you can use a single node; while for multi-class problems, you’ll use multiple nodes, depending on the number of classes.\n",

This cycle is what we generally refer to as the training phase, and the process of searching for the right weights is called optimization.\n",
